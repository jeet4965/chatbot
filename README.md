# chatbot
I’m excited to share my latest project: a Python-based chatbot that leverages natural language processing techniques to engage in dynamic conversations. This repository contains the full source code, including the core implementation of the chatbot, training data, and instructions for setting up and running the project. The chatbot is built using popular Python libraries such as NLTK and TensorFlow, and it features a range of functionalities from basic question-answering to more complex dialogue management. Whether you’re interested in exploring the code, contributing to the project, or using it as a foundation for your own chatbot, I hope you find this repository useful. Please feel free to open issues or submit pull requests if you have suggestions or improvements!
